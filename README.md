# TinyKnob - Rotary Encoder with USB Interface
TinyKnob is a rotary encoder with a USB interface based on the ATtiny45/85 and the V-USB software-only implementation of USB1.1 devices on AVR microcontrollers (https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html). The example code implements a volume control knob for PCs which works without installing any driver by acting like a generic HID device.
